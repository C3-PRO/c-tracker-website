	For this study, researchers at <a href="http://www.childrenshospital.org" target="_blank">Boston Children’s Hospital</a> are asking <i>people with hepatitis&nbsp;C</i> to use their smartphones to report information about themselves that may improve how hepatitis&nbsp;C is treated.

</p>
<p>
	If you participate in this study, we will ask you about your health, activities, medications, and the ways in which hepatitis&nbsp;C has impacted your daily life.
	This information will be reported anonymously—meaning the researchers won’t know who you are.
</p>

<h1>How the Study Works</h1>

<p>
	The C&nbsp;Tracker app will collect information on your health through short surveys that will include questions like:
	<ul>
		<li>Which antiviral medication are you currently taking or have you taken in the past?</li>
		<li>During the past seven days, how many hours did you miss from work because of problems associated with your hepatitis&nbsp;C?</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The C&nbsp;Tracker app will set occasional reminders to use the app to complete these study tasks.
	You will be reminded about every 4 months for an overall survey and about every 2 weeks for a quick survey, asking about how well you recently fared.
	You can choose not to have the app provide reminders.
