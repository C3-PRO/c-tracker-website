<h1>About this Study</h1>
<p>
	For this study, researchers at <a href="http://www.childrenshospital.org" target="_blank">Boston Children’s Hospital</a> are asking <i>people with hepatitis&nbsp;C</i> to use their smartphones to report information about themselves that may improve how hepatitis&nbsp;C is treated.

<p>
	If you participate in this study, we will ask you about your health, activities, medications, and the ways in which hepatitis&nbsp;C has impacted your daily life.
	This information will be reported anonymously—meaning the researchers <a href="PrivacyPolicy.html">won’t know who you are</a>.
</p>

<h1>How the Study Works</h1>
<img class="float-right" src="static/HowItWorks.png" srcset="static/HowItWorks@2x.png 2x, static/HowItWorks@3x.png 3x" alt="">
<p>
	The C&nbsp;Tracker app will collect information on your health through short surveys that will include questions like:
	<ul>
		<li>Which antiviral medication are you currently taking or have you taken in the past?</li>
		<li>During the past seven days, how many hours did you miss from work because of problems associated with your hepatitis&nbsp;C?</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The C&nbsp;Tracker app will set occasional reminders to use the app to complete these study tasks.
	You will be reminded about every 4 months for an overall survey and about every 2 weeks for a quick survey, asking about how well you recently fared.
	You can choose not to have the app provide reminders.

<h1>What is Hepatitis&nbsp;C?</h1>
<img class="float-right" src="static/HepC.png" srcset="static/HepC@2x.png 2x, static/HepC@3x.png 3x" alt="">
<p>
	Hepatitis&nbsp;C is a liver disease cause by <i>infection with hepatitis&nbsp;C virus</i> (HCV).
	Hepatitis&nbsp;C is a blood-borne virus.
</p>
<p>
	Most people with hepatitis&nbsp;C are in the “baby-boomer” generation and acquired their infections decades ago.
	Today, most people with new HCV infections become infected with the HCV by sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs.
	For a minority of people, hepatitis&nbsp;C is a short-term illness, but for 70%–85% of people who become infected with hepatitis&nbsp;C, long-term, chronic infection follows.
	Although not everyone with chronic hepatitis&nbsp;C progresses to serious liver disease, chronic hepatitis&nbsp;C can be a serious disease than can result in long-term health problems, including liver scarring (which can lead to cirrhosis), liver failure, liver cancer, even death.
	The majority of infected persons might not be aware of their infection because they are not clinically ill.
</p>
<p>
	There is no vaccine for hepatitis&nbsp;C.
	The best way to prevent hepatitis&nbsp;C is by avoiding behaviors that can spread the disease, especially injecting drugs.
	Fortunately, highly effective, very well tolerated oral medications are available that, effectively, can cure hepatitis&nbsp;C, but their high cost has limited their broad application.
